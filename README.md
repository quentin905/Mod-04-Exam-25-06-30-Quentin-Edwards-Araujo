# Part A   https://repairit.wondershare.com/excel-repair/excel-not-enough-memory.html

I've found a list of the most popular and helpful questions that people should ask themselves if they were to encounter this issue on they're own. first off "How much RAM does my computer have? knowing the amount of physical memory will be able to help determine if your computer is in need of more RAM to accomplish the task "here isn't enough memory to complete this action. Try using less data or closing other applications. To increase memory availability, consider:
-Using a 64-bit version of Microsoft Excel.
-Adding memory to your device". Another question that should be asked is "Could I close some tabs in Chrome?" or "Is there any applications that are consuming to much memory?" other unnecessary apps that may cause the performance of your system. Excel cannot complete this task with available resources. "Choose less data or close other applications".



#Part B  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/performance/stop-error-or-blue-screen-error-troubleshooting

This website explains why the system can just stop out nowhere and how? For instance when there's blue screen they says its a bug check or more well known as a the blue screen it can be caused by third-party driver code, by hardware issues, by microsoft code or either by unkown reasons or causes because of the memory. it has also provieded the steps to help with the problem. making sure that the BIOS would be updated, making sure you had the latest update for windows and others.

Part 2 of B  https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-check-for-memory-problems-in-windows

The website starts out as "how to check for memory problems in windows". basically providing the correct steps here and there to ensure you can anylize what is wrong and explains on how to fix the issue of your troubleshoot. if windows was freezing or crashing it would most likely be becasue of the RAM and because the chip itself has just gone bad like anything else. before comming to that conclusion the first and only step would be to run a scan on it.

Part C Part 2  https://www.boostitco.com/blog/ways-to-fix-programs-that-wont-open-on-windows-10/

"Common causes of the program not opening" is the title of the wesbiste it provides general knowledge what can cause issues for programs not opening and why there are not opening. They could be corrupeted, outdated, something to do with the user account control settings and many more. later twoards the mid part of this website if you to miss this it would probably affect your way. It starts from Troubleshooting methods, it gives the core way to fix the issue and usually this the genral way for any computer or any program to fix the issue and it always works most of the time.

https://uis.georgetown.edu/file-explorer/
https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/windowsbasics/working-with-files/1/

For these three webiste they provided the same amount of key knowledge on how to properly use the software of windowds file explorer but the scond came in the a table of information which i found more particular becasue it looked way simpler and gave more carifaction there steps. the last website was known as fairly simple to any other but still gave good info woth steps including there own pictures for each step i found this helpful for those arent always able to learn just by reading but better by seeing clearly. And lasetly for the first link that I have typed twoards the top besides the title Question 2, it gave imagies as well but what i found that is always nice there always provide a help team for buigger companies if not undertsood through there information.

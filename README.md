I've found a list of the most popular and helpful questions that people should ask themselves if they were to encounter this issue on they're own. first off "How much RAM does my computer have? knowing the amount of physical memory will be able to help determine if your computer is in need of more RAM to accomplish the task "here isn't enough memory to complete this action. Try using less data or closing other applications. To increase memory availability, consider:
-Using a 64-bit version of Microsoft Excel.
-Adding memory to your device". Another question that should be asked is "Could I close some tabs in Chrome?" or "Is there any applications that are consuming to much memory?" other unnecessary apps that may cause the performance of your system. Excel cannot complete this task with available resources. "Choose less data or close other applications".
